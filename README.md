# Challenge 1

## For this challenge I changed the div tags to follow semantic HTML format and added alt tags to the image sections. 
## I added a main, aside, header, nav, and, footer tags to make things more readable.

## I added in comments where I made changes, so that the next dev would know what I did. 

## In the css style sheet I combined several classes that had the same styling, so it was more readable. 
## I commented out the code that was redundant because I didn't want to completely delete it in case the next dev wanted to see it.
